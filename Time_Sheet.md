Professor Houben approved the project on Mixture-of-Gaussians (MoG) but noted that achieving all goals might be challenging. He highlighted that MoG models are suited for unsupervised learning in low-dimensional feature spaces, requiring feature reduction through preprocessing (e.g., estimating object size or shape parameters).
